# cs_search_engine_express
NYU Dynamic Web Applications Assignment 7. This is a lightweight Express app that uses the Google API to perform a user defined search inside of a pre-built CS Curriculum Search Engine. 

There now is a login page that the user should first go to, to then be redirected to the search page. After running the app go to [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login) and register or log in. After successfully registering a new user or logging in as a current user, you will be redirected to the search page.
